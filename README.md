# Vim flog git-forest

Integrates the [`git-forest`](https://github.com/TamaMcGlinn/git-forest) commandline tool to show a prettier unicode
git log inside of [vim-flog](https://github.com/rbong/vim-flog).

# Installation

Install using your favourite plugin manager, e.g.

```
Plug 'TamaMcGlinn/vim-flog-forest'
```

# History

See [this issue](https://github.com/rbong/vim-flog/issues/49) where the tool was first found and discussed for use in vim-flog,
and this [pull request](https://github.com/rbong/vim-flog/pull/65) in which we conclude it is better to spawn a separate plugin,
to keep development of forest and vim-flog separate.
